## 1.1 Infinite Series
### 1.1.1 Geometric Series
$$\sum_{k=0}^{n} r^{k} = 1 + r + r^2 + ... + r^n = \frac{1-r^{n+1}}{1-r}$$

Let 0 < r < 1, then the sum of an infinite geometric series is:
$$\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} r^{k} = \lim_{n\to\infty} \frac{1-r^{n+1}}{1-r} = \frac{1}{1-r}$$

* Other variations can arise if you either differentiate the above or integrate and play around with such combination of operations
  
### 1.1.2 Binomial Series
$$(a + b)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} {}^{n}C_{k} a^k b^{n-k}$$

Let 0 < p < 1, then it is obvious that $$\sum_{k=0}^{n} {}^{n}C_{k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k} = 1$$
