# Lecture 3: Set Theory

>**Definition**: Probability is the measure of the size of a subset in a sample space

## 2.1 Set Theory
### 2.1.1 Set
> Definition: A **set** is a collection of objects. We denote $A = [\xi_1,\xi_2,\xi_3,...,\xi_n\] as a set, and $\xi_{i}$ is the i-th element in the set.$

**Notation:**
 * $\xi \in A:$ An object $\xi$ is in set A
 * $\xi \not\in A:$ An object $\xi$ is not in set A

**Finite, Countable, Uncountable**
 *  Finite: $A = [0, 1]$
 *  Countable: $A =[2,4,6,8,...] $
 *  Uncountable: $A = [x |  0 < x < 1]$

**Open and Closed Intervals**
 * (a,b) = {$x$ | a $< x <$ b}
 * [a,b] = {$x$ | a $\leq x  \leq$ b}

> A set can contain functions !
>
> Examples: (a) Set of Straight line - f(x) = ax + b; 'a' and 'b' are the sources of randomness
